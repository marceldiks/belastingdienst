## Create a BuildConfig for the Java Application

The team is ready to onboard a new Java Application. The PM wants to start building the image of the application

Source code https://github.com/musghost/example-java-app

**Objectives:**

- Create a new BuildConfig and ImageStream to create the Container Image of the application
- Keep in mind that the Dockerfile makes use of a private registry `registry.digitalocean.com/openshiftcourse/gradle:8-jdk17`
  - You will need to create a secret with those credentials
  - You will also need to make reference to that secret in the BuildConfig to use it when pulling the image
- Ask your trainer what the auth credentials are for this registry

## Continuous Integration tasks

Now the PM wants to continue with setting up the pipeline to test the source code, which later will be part of the CI.

To test the source code, the following steps are required:

- Run the security dependency analysis test
- Run the Unit Tests
- Build the tar file
- Trigger the BuildConfig

The commands are documented in the readme file of the java application

**Objectives:**

- Create a Task to clone the repository with this image `quay.io/wire/alpine-git`
- Create a Task for each step to test the source code
- Test the new Tasks within a Pipeline and triggered manually
  - Don't forget that Tasks need to share a Volume (Workspace)

## Continuous Delivery tasks

It is time to deploy the application. Create the k8s objects to run the application in your project

**Objectives:**

- Create a new Deployment (NOT DEPLOYMENT CONFIG) to run the new built Container Image
  - You might need this guide to use the image from the ImageStream: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/openshift_images/using-imagestreams-with-kube-resources.html
  - Also enable triggering automatically a new updated deployment for changes on the imagestream. You might need this guide https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/openshift_images/triggering-updates-on-imagestream-changes.html

- Expose the Deployment and Route
