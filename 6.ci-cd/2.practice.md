## Add a finally Task to the Pipeline to cleanup the volume

The finally Task will always run after all the tasks are completed. In our use-case, we need a finally task to clean up the volume to guarantee that next time it is used, it is cleaned up

How to include the finally task in a Pipeline:

```yaml
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: tests
      taskRef:
        name: integration-test
  finally:
    - name: cleanup-test
      taskRef:
        name: cleanup
```

**Objectives:**

- Create a new Task called `cleanup` that removes the everything **inside** the workspace path.
- Include the Task in your current pipeline
- Rerun the pipeline to verify that the task is indeed cleaning up the volume

## Publish the security dependency analysis report

Your team wants to make the report available so that anyone can verify the state of the dependencies.

The command `gradle dependencyCheckAnalyze` generates a report in html format in the directory `build/reports` called `dependency-check-report.html`.

The idea is to publish the generated report with a Deployment, once the report is available.

**Objectives:**

- Create a new Task called `report` that:
    - Creates or updates a ConfigMap called `dependency-security-report`
    - The ConfigMap should have a key called `index.html` and the content should be the file `build/reports/dependency-check-report.html`
    - You can generate the ConfigMap with `oc create configmap` command
- Create a new Deployment that makes use of the nginx image `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/nginx-120`
    - It should have only **one** replica
    - Mount the configmap as volume in the directory `/opt/app-root/src`
- Expose the Deployment and the Service

### Create the definition files for your java application

**Objectives:**

- Create a directory in your `example-java-app` fork repository called `deploy`.
- Create a new branch called `feat/infrastructure-as-code`
- In the `deploy` directory create a kustomization application with the following resources that you created to build, deploy and expose the java application, as well as the Pipelines to run CI:
    - ImageStream
    - BuildConfig
    - Deployment
    - Service
    - Route
    - Tekton Tasks
    - Tekton Pipeline
    - EventListener, Trigger and Trigger template
- Commit your changes and push the branch to github.
- Create a new Pull Request and add @musghost as reviewer, **do not merge the Pull Request*
