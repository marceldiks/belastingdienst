## Run a greeting application

Objectives of this section:

- Deploy an application *greeting app*
- Deploy another application that consumes the *greeting app*
- Analize if the application is doing ok

### Hands-on

Start Docker desktop with k8s or colima with k8s

```bash
colima start --kubernetes --cpu 3 --memory 4
```

Build the container image

```bash
# ask for the user and password
docker login registry.digitalocean.com

# build the image
docker build -t registry.digitalocean.com/openshiftcourse/YOURNAME:latest .

# push the image to the registry
docker push registry.digitalocean.com/openshiftcourse/YOURNAME:latest
```

Create a new namespace called `greeting`, then apply the mysql deployment.

```bash
kubectl apply -f sources/python-app-mysql-splunk/mysql-deployment.yaml
```

Create the required database and the table for the greeting app with the following code

```sql
CREATE DATABASE flask_example;
USE flask_example;

CREATE TABLE user (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

Once created, deploy the greeting application

```bash
kubectl apply -f sources/python-app-mysql-splunk/greeting-deployment.yaml
```

The application is using a service of type `NodePort`, check what NodePort is being used and access via `http://localhost:NODE_PORT`, then test the application.

Now it is time to deloy the *client app*. This app will perform multiple requests to the *greeting app*, selecting multiple values, some of the performed requests will cause the *greeting app* to respond with an error (response code 500).

```bash
kubectl apply -f sources/python-app-mysql-splunk/client.yaml
```

## Troubleshoot issues with the application

**Objective:**

- Analize the logs of the applications and find what application is misbehaving

## Install otel collector

```bash
# Set token
export SPLUNK_TOKEN=xxxx
export SPLUNK_ENV_NAME=YOUR_NAME

# Install chart repository
helm repo add splunk-otel-collector-chart https://signalfx.github.io/splunk-otel-collector-chart

# Install helm chart for the collector
helm install --set="splunkObservability.accessToken=$SPLUNK_TOKEN,clusterName=my-cluster,splunkObservability.realm=eu0,gateway.enabled=false,splunkObservability.profilingEnabled=true,environment=$SPLUNK_ENV_NAME" --generate-name splunk-otel-collector-chart/splunk-otel-collector
```

## Instrument the application

We will start by adding the package `splunk-opentelemetry[all]` and `opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask` to the `requirements.txt` file.

The first application we will instrument is the *client app*.

We will update the entrypoint with this command:

```bash
splunk-py-trace python3 client.py
```

That means we only need to change the `command` key of the container template in the pod defined in `client.yaml`.

Now, the *greeting app* needs a bit more than that. Since it is a flask web server, we need to add the following imports:

```python
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
```

Then, after the app variable is created, add the code sentence `FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)`.

```python
app = Flask(__name__) # Add the line after this sentence 

FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app) # This is the added line!
```

We also need to modify the file `greeting-deployment.yaml` file to include the `command` key with the new entrypoint `splunk-py-trace python3 app.py`

This is all needed to instrument the code. It is time to build the image and push it to the registry.

```bash
# build the base image
docker build -t registry.digitalocean.com/openshiftcourse/YOURNAME:latest .

# push it to the registry
docker push registry.digitalocean.com/openshiftcourse/YOURNAME:latest
```

As last point, we need to indicate where the traces need to be sent, that is the collector, which runs as DaemonSet and it is listening to the port 4317.

Modify the ***client app*** to add the following environment variables:

```yaml
- name: OTEL_SERVICE_NAME
    value: client-greeting-app # the name of the service is client-greeting-app
- name: SPLUNK_OTEL_AGENT
    valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
        fieldPath: status.hostIP
- name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
    value: http://$(SPLUNK_OTEL_AGENT):4317
```

Modify the ***greeting app*** to add the following environment variables:

```yaml
- name: OTEL_SERVICE_NAME
    value: greeting-app # the name of the service is just greeting-app
- name: SPLUNK_OTEL_AGENT
    valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
        fieldPath: status.hostIP
- name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
    value: http://$(SPLUNK_OTEL_AGENT):4317
```

Once the application is pushed to the registry and the environment variables are added, then apply the new manifests files

```bash
kubectl apply -f sources/python-app-mysql-splunk/mysql-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f sources/python-app-mysql-splunk/client.yaml
```

Verify that the applications are up and running

## Observe with APM

1. Access to the dashboard
2. On the left sidebar, click on the second menu APM
3. Click on environments selector on the top left and select your name
4. Click on explore and see the flow of traffic between the client, greeting and db
5. Go back by clicking on the button *< Overview* on the left top side.
6. Click on traces
7. Browse some of the traces and check the details of the span
8. Filter the traces by toggling the option *Errors Only*
9. Find out the fout traces and click on one of them
10. Check what error messages you get from the traces

## Fix the issues

1. Fix the error in the `app.py`
2. Build and push the image again
3. Once the image is pushed, then delete the pods, k8s will pull the new versions
4. The new traces will be reflected after 3 minutes in the dashboard.
5. Check in the dashboard if the error was fixed

## Analize performance issues

1. Add small resource limits to the mysql database
   1. This means the database will be recreated, create the table again.
   2. Add these limits: memory 250m, cpu 200.
2. Check the performance in the span traces of the requests
