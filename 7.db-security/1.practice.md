## Run a new mysql database

**Objectives:**

- Based on previous practice [number 3](../4.openshift/3.practice.md), run a new mysql database in Openshift.
- Run the following SQL code in the database:

```SQL
CREATE DATABASE flask_example;
USE flask_example;

CREATE TABLE user (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL
);
```

## Onboard a new python application

**Objectives:**

- Create a new public repository with your github account called `insecure-python-app`
  - Run `git init` from your **local** machine to initialize the repo.
  - The repository should only contain the source code in `sources/python-app-mysql` stored in this repo
- Build this image using a BuildConfig
- Run the application with a new Deployment
  - As you notice, the application requires some environment variables to connect to the mysql server. Please give it the root access ðŸ˜ˆ

## Fix the application via SQL users

**Objectives:**

- Create a new user different than root to allow him to be able to insert and query records. No more than that
- Upgrade the environment variables of the application to make use of the new credentials
- Test if the problem is solved

## Fix the application via code

**Objectives:**

- Put back the credentials of root user in the environment variables of the application
- Create a new Pull Request to fix the application. Share it with the instructor.
- Build the image again and make sure that the new code is deployed
- Test if the problem is solved with the new code
